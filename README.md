Exploring code as an art material.

http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org

This is a bit of a different project in terms of scope. Code is often thought about in terms of building solutions, but our goal is a little different:

`Create an open source piece of *art* using code and *share* it with people.`

I'm not going to tell you what art to make, but I'm here to help you on the journey. 

Lets make no mistake this is a deeply technical project that will require working with and contributing to many open-source projects. There is also the opportunity (if you want) to look at various programming languages like Ruby, C++ & Clojure. A key part of the project is sharing your work with the programming and wider community. 

Most of my experience is with live coding of music and visuals as part of a performance. So that might a good place to start, but anything is possible. Examples are a good place explore for ideas.

### Example Code Art

* Stanford code poetry slam - http://stanford.edu/~mkagen/codepoetryslam/
* Repl Electric - live coding as a performance: http://www.repl-electric.com
* Jack Rusher - Browser based art with thi.ng - http://proscenium.rusher.com/geometer
* Katie Sicchio - Exploring code and dance - http://blog.sicchio.com/
* International Conference on Live Coding - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN-9RKW_izkIUMH0eQ60H2g

There are a number of open-source tools that might be helpful it getting started. 

### Tools
