# Poetic Computation
Exploring code as an art material.

http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org

This is a bit of a different project in terms of scope. Code is often thought about in terms of building solutions, but our goal is a little different:

Demonstrate and share the power of code as an artistic material.

That sounds a bit fancy, what we really are looking at is:

Creating an open source piece of *art* using Ruby and Sonic Pi and *share* it with people.

In terms of issues or features this project is different in terms of not wanting to tell you what art to make. I'm here to help you on the journey.

Sonic Pi (https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi) is a Ruby based tool used to create music using code. Its used in schools to teach music and by artists and musicians. I work as part of the Sonic Pi Core team and as part of this project you will meet the rest of the Sonic Pi team and have the opportunity to contribute. The idea is to start working on your idea for your art piece and through learning Sonic Pi help effect its design with your feedback + needs.

Lets make no mistake this is a deeply technical project that will require working with and contributing to many open-source projects. There is also the opportunity (if you want) to look at various programming languages outside of Ruby like C++ & Clojure. It can also not just be about music, there are lots of visuals tools used to combine music and graphics. A key part of the project is sharing your work with the programming and wider community.

Its also worth mentioning you don't need to be a musician or have anything music theory knowledge. Sonic Pi has a very detailed tutorial and manual, and the live coding world is full of people who's only instrument is code.

Examples are a good place explore for ideas.
